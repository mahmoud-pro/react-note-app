## Features

1. **Create Note:** You can easily create a new note by clicking on the "Create" button. A new note will be added to the list.

2. **Update Note:** To update a note, click on the note you want to edit. This will open the note in edit mode, allowing you to make changes. After editing, you can save your changes by clicking the "Save" button.

3. **Delete Note:** If you want to delete a note, simply click the "Delete" button next to the note you wish to remove. A confirmation prompt will ensure you don't accidentally delete a note.

4. **Search Note:** You can search for specific notes by using the search bar at the top. As you type, the app will dynamically filter the notes to display only those containing your search query.

5. **Save to Local Storage:** All your notes are automatically saved to your browser's local storage. This means you can close the app and come back later to find your notes exactly as you left them.
